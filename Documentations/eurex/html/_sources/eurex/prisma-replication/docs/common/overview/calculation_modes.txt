Calculation Modes
=================

The Eurex Clearing implementation supports two different ways of calculating the P&L vectors required to produce
initial margin, each with their own strengths.

These modes apply only to OTC calculations; ETD calculations always use full revaluation from the daily reference prices
loaded into the environment.


Full Revaluation
----------------

The underlying OpenGamma Platform provides all the pricing and risk capabilities required to value OTC trades from their
definitions. The default calculation mode is to use this functionality in conjunction with the full scenario data loaded
from the Eurex Clearing Transparency Enabler files, to value each trade under each scenario. The P&L vectors required for
initial margin are calculated by subtracting the base valuation from the valuation under each scenario.

While this is the most accurate approach, it is also the most calculation-intensive for OTC trades.

.. _delta_approximation:

Delta Approximation
-------------------

An alternative to full revaluation is to estimate the P&L under each scenario directly from the first-order
sensitivities to each risk factor. P&L vectors are produced by considering the shocks applied to the risk factors under
each scenario.

There are two ways to use delta approximation: in conjunction with the full trade definitions, or from sensitivities.

Using trade definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When trade definitions are provided, the underlying OpenGamma Platform is used to calculate the sensitivities in the
base scenario.

The use of the full trade definition also means the trade can be valued. This allows an additional term to be
incorporated into the P&L calculation to estimate the effect on P&L due to currency exposure, leading to slightly more
accurate results than using delta approximation with sensitivities.

For further details on available otc formats, see :ref:`OTC Formats <otc_trade_formats>`.

Using sensitivities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implementation supports the import of sensitivities to risk factors in place of full trade details.
These may be the the sensitivities of a single trade, or the aggregated sensitivities of many trades.

Sensitivities are the fastest way to obtain results as they can be used directly to estimate the P&L under each scenario.
However, it is not possible to value the trades they represent, so the effect on the P&L due to the currency exposure,
which can be included when using the full trade definition with delta approximation, can no longer be included. This
may lead to slightly less accurate results.

Sensitivities can be combined with full trade definitions, enabling use-cases like fast what-if where a proposed trade
is combined with the sensitivity profile of an existing portfolio.

For details on the sensitivity input format, see :doc:`../trade_parsers/eurex_sensitivities_csv`.

Library Architecture
--------------------

The Eurex Clearing PME library contains a set of *core interfaces* through which the full functionality is exposed.
The primary interfaces are:

* ``MarginEnvironment``, which owns the data that has been loaded, and allows calculations to be performed on this data. The other core interfaces are accessed through this environment.
* ``MarginData``, providing the API for loading data.
* ``MarginCalculator``, providing the API for performing calculations.

The logical structure of the library is illustrated in the architecture diagram below.

The library uses the OpenGamma Platform for its OTC market risk calculations, which in turn relies on several third-party dependencies.

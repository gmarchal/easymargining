Eurex Clearing PME
==================

The Eurex Clearing Prisma Margin Estimator (PME) is OpenGamma's independent implementation of all three major Eurex Clearing margin methodologies: Eurex PRISMA for ETD, EurexOTC, and Eurex Cross Margining.

It provides a set of high-level APIs for calculating initial margin on any given eligible-to-clear portfolio. The implementation is distributed as a Java library along with necessary third-party dependencies.

Although not a stand-alone tool on its own, it can be easily embedded into existing applications or used
as the basis for new applications to allow Eurex margin simulation in any context required by a modern
trading firm.

About The Documentation
-----------------------

The Eurex Cleaing PME comes packaged with a number of tools to help you easily integrate it into your applications.

In addition to this high level documentation, the distribution includes Javadocs for all the core APIs necessary to add Eurex margin calculation support to your applications. It also has a number of examples in a ready-made project that you can use as a template to get started.

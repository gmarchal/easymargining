Portfolios can be imported from data files in several supported formats.

.. use bold type to denote headers, avoiding these appearing in the toc

**ETD formats**

ETD position files can be imported from the following formats:

* :doc:`../../common/trade_parsers/eurex_etd_csv`
* :doc:`../../common/trade_parsers/fixml`

.. _otc_trade_formats:

**OTC formats**

OTC trade files can be imported from the following formats:

* :doc:`../../common/trade_parsers/eurex_otc_csv`
* :doc:`../../common/trade_parsers/fpml`

**Sensitivity-based formats**

It is also possible to represent one or more OTC trades as sensitivities to risk factors, rather than providing
trade definitions. These can be loaded from the following file format:

* :doc:`../../common/trade_parsers/eurex_sensitivities_csv`

**Loading programmatically**


For more advanced use cases, it is also possible to build portfolios
by constructing OpenGamma domain objects programmatically. This gives
the user full access to functionality supported by the trade model.
For further information, see :doc:`../advanced/trade_model`.

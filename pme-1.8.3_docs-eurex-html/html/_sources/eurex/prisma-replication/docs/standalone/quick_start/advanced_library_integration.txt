Advanced Library Integration
============================

While many basic use cases can be satisfied just through library integration involving
files, there are many advanced use cases for the Eurex PME that benefit from deeper
integration with OpenGamma Margining APIs.

Specifically, the following common requirements are candidates for going beyond
basic library integration:

* Low-latency pre-trade analysis, where the cost of trade serialization
  and deserialization is undesirable.
* Cases where there are existing sources of index fixing and holiday data,
  where serialization to and from files may not be desirable.
* Historical or future analysis, where multiple market data contexts must be
  maintained and the valuation date varied.

It is always recommended that basic library integration is performed first
to ensure that you have a clean base-line to ensure numerical accuracy
and help isolate regressions. In addition, Eurex and OpenGamma support
personnel may ask for portfolios for methodology and technical support
to ensure reproducibility of any variations.

While the examples and javadocs distributed with the PME provide additional
documentation on precisely how to perform many of these actions, please
see the following sections of the documentation for key areas of
advanced library integration:

* :doc:`Trade Model<../advanced/trade_model>` and portfolio API
* :doc:`Historical Fixings<../../common/data/fixings>` data format and API
* :doc:`Holiday Calendars<../../common/data/holidays>` data format and API

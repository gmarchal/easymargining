Quick Start
===========

The Eurex Clearing PME is designed to provide you with a consistent path for
successful integration into your development environment and production applications.
It focuses on following a logical set of steps, each of which can then be verified
numerically with the step before it, to ensure that programming errors are minimized.
It also provides the fastest way to get up and running with the Eurex PME in your
existing applications, and gradually introduces key concepts and APIs.

Before you get started, please ensure you have installed the following prerequisites:

* A Java 7 or 8 SDK
* A Java IDE
* Apache Maven (3.2+)

You will need to prepare the following data:

* A portfolio on which to calculate Initial Margin in one of the :doc:`supported input formats <../data/trade_parsers>`
* At least one day of OTC and/or ETD Transparency Enabler :doc:`market data files <../../common/data/eurex_market_data>` downloaded from Eurex
* A :doc:`historical fixings file <../../common/data/fixings>` (OTC only)
* A :doc:`holiday calendars file <../../common/data/holidays>` (OTC only)
* :ref:`Cross margining configuration files <cross_margining>` (cross margining only)

You are now ready to :doc:`set up your development environment <set_up_development_environment>`.

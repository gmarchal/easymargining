Running the Examples
====================

The examples project contains code which demonstrates how to use Eurex Clearing PME to perform calculations.
It also contains the sample market data required by the calculations. The steps to set up the examples project are
detailed in :doc:`Setting up a Development Environment <set_up_development_environment>`.

The example code includes a number of example classes. They are standard Java classes with ``main`` methods
so they can be run from an IDE. The examples output their calculation results to the console,
formatted as ASCII tables.

Calculation of Initial Margin for OTC Trades
--------------------------------------------

The class which demonstrates calculation of Initial Margin for OTC trades is ``EurexPrismaOtcMarginClient``.
This calculates Present Value for each trade and a full set of measures for the portfolio including Initial Margin.

This example requires at least 3GB of memory so the following argument should passed to ``java`` when running::

    -Xmx3g

Calculation of Initial Margin for ETD Trades
--------------------------------------------

The class which demonstrates calculation of Initial Margin for ETD trades is ``EurexPrismaEtdMarginClient``.
This calculates Present Value for each trade and a full set of measures for the portfolio including
Initial Margin and Historical VAR.

Calculation of Cash Flows
-------------------------

The class which demonstrates calculation of cash flows is ``EurexPrismaCashFlowClient``. This calculates cash flows for
both legs of a swap.

This example requires at least 3GB of memory so the following argument should passed to ``java`` when running::

    -Xmx3g

Basic API Integration Example
-----------------------------

The example class ``EurexPrismaBasicApiIntegrationClient`` follows the same pattern as the previous examples,
but rather than parsing files to load holidays, fixings and market data, this data is provided
directly via the API from within the example itself. This demonstrates creating the relevant
business objects directly and can provide a starting point for integrating with a data source other
than flat files.

This example requires at least 3GB of memory so the following argument should passed to ``java`` when running::

    -Xmx3g



Running from the Command Line
-----------------------------

The class ``EurexPrismaCommandLineExample`` demonstrates how to use Eurex Clearing PME to run calculations
from the command line. It calculates Present Value for each trade and a range of measures including Initial Margin
for the portfolio. It requires three arguments:

* ``-d`` valuation date in the format ``yyyy-MM-dd``, e.g. ``2015-06-03``
* ``-m`` path to a directory containing market data
* ``-p`` path to the file defining the portfolio

The following arguments can be used run the command line example with the sample data
included in the examples project::

    -d 2015-06-03 -p src/main/resources/trade/etdTrades.csv -m src/main/resources/marketData

This assumes the working directory is the root directory of the examples project.

This example requires at least 3GB of memory so the following argument should passed to ``java`` when running::

    -Xmx3g

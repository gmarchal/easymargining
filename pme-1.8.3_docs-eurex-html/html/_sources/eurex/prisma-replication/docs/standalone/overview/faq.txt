Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

System Requirements
===================

**Can I run the Eurex Clearing PME if I do not have a machine which meets the recommended hardware specification?**
  Yes you can run the solution on a smaller machine. However it is recommended that you only
  load the market data that you require, for example just OTC data or only the open interest
  theoretical instrument file for ETD. If you do run on a machine with less memory and load
  all the available data then you will find that the calculations are slower than expected.
  
**What if my operating system isn't in the list of supported systems?**
  This is the list of operating systems that the Eurex Clearing PME has been tested on.
  However, as a Java library it is expected to run successfully on other operating systems.
  

Market Data
===========

**Why do I have to provide my own fixings and holiday files?**
  For licensing reasons CCPs are not able to publish the fixings and holiday data that they
  use in their calculations. However, this data should be readily available within your own
  firm for your valuations. CSV parsers have been provided with Eurex Clearing PME to make 
  it easy for you to integrate this data.

**Do I need to provide fixings data for all eligible products?**
  In general you only need to provide the fixings necessary to price your trades. In particular,
  if you do not trade zero coupon inflation swaps then you do not need to provide inflation
  fixings.
  
**What holiday data do I need to provide?**
  You will need to provide the holidays required to price your trades correctly. Providing
  past holidays is important to make sure that pricing does not fail trying to find fixings
  on days when they are not available.
  
**Inflation fixings are for the month. Why do I have to provide a day in the input file?**
  The fixings file format expects an actual date to be provided. However it does not matter
  which day of the month is provided as the solution will automatically sort this out. Some
  data providers use the first day of the month whilst others use the last day of the month.
  The parser is flexible to allow for this.
  
**Do I have to reload market data every time I want to calculate a margin?**
  No you only need to load the market data once into a ``MarginEnvironment``, say at the start
  of day. You can then run all your calculation requests against that environment.
  
  
Trades and Positions
====================

**What products are supported?**
  The Eurex Clearing PME supports all products which use the Eurex PRISMA for ETD or Eurex OTC
  methodologies (see :ref:`product_scope`. There are
  some known limitations to the supported OTC trades which are listed in :ref:`known_limitations`. 
  Any ETD products in the Eurex Transparency Enabler files are supported. 
  
**Are any eligibility checks performed on trades?**
  There are no specific eligibility checks performed on trades so it is possible that the
  Eurex Clearing PME will calculate margin on an ineligible trade. The Eurex Transparency Enabler 
  files ensure that margin can only be calculated for OTC trades in valid currencies or for
  ETD positions on valid securities.  Checks are also performed to exclude matured trades
  and trades with a termination date beyond the end of the provided curves.

**Does the Eurex Clearing PME perform any netting?**
  The solution does not perform any netting on ETD trades (see :ref:`known_limitations`).
  To calculate the margin correctly for an ETD portfolio it requires it to be provided as
  total positions. Netting will be performed of long and short positions to calculate a net
  position if it is provided as a single record in either CSV or FIXML format.
  
**My trades are not available in one of the provided formats. How do I load them into the PME?**
  The PME supports the file formats supported by Eurex but if you cannot access your trades
  in any of these formats then you have two options; you can take the format that you 
  do have and convert it to one of the supported formats or you can load the trades
  by constructing the OpenGamma domain objects programmatically. For further information see
  :ref:`loading_portfolios`.

Margin Calculation
==================

**Can I use the Eurex Clearing PME to calculate variation margin?**
  The Eurex Clearing PME calculates initial margin. Variation margin is not available as
  an output. However, it is possible to output PV for all trades, and for premium paid up
  front options this is equivalent to the premium margin. 
  
**Can I choose the currency that my margin is calculated in?**
  You can choose to calculate your margin in either EUR or CHF.
  
**How can I use the Eurex Clearing PME to better understand my margin?**
  The output from the Eurex Clearing PME provides a full breakdown of all the elements of 
  the Eurex algorithms. It also provides some additional trade level information such as PV
  and P&L. Therefore it is possible to understand, for example, which trades are contributing
  most to the VaR components of the margin or what is driving the level of the Liquidity Risk.
 
**I am trying to do a what-if analysis. My base portfolio is a sensitivity profile and my new trade is in trade format. What does my calculation request need to be?**
  If any part of your portfolio is provided as a sensitivity profile then you need to 
  use the delta approximation calculation mode (see :ref:`calculation_modes`.
  The PME cannot combine full revaluation and delta approximation modes when calculating
  OTC margins. Similarly if you are trying to do cross margining and have your OTC 
  portfolio as a sensitivity profile then you will need to use delta approximation mode.

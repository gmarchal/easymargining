Known Limitations
=================

General
=======

**Multiple margin environment instances causes memory leak**
  Construction of multiple ``MarginEnvironment`` instances, either sequentially
  or simultaneously, will result in a memory leak if they do not have an
  externally provided ``ExecutorService``. If you need to create multiple
  ``MarginEnvironment`` instances, you must manage your ``ExecutorService``
  directly. See :ref:`concurrency` for more information.

ETD
===

**Position netting**
  ETD trades are not netted. If ETDs are provided as individual trades (i.e. 
  multiple records for the same security) then netting will not occur and an
  incorrect margin will be calculated. In particular, Liquidity Risk Adjustment
  will be based on each individual trade rather than the overall net position for
  that security.
  
OTC

General
_______

**Additional payments**
  Additional payments (for example upfront or other trade fees) attached to the 
  FpML trade specification are ignored.

Swap
____

**Lump payment amounts for fixed legs**
  For fixed legs with zero-coupon payment at trade maturity the trade model
  does not support a lump payment amount (instead of a rate). The value in the 
  FpML / CSV is used as the notional for the fixed leg, with the fixed rate set at
  100% and a day count convention of 1/1 to simulate the effect of the fixed amount.
    
**Fixed first rates**
  A fixed rate can be set for the first reset period of a swap floating leg, but this 
  is currently only supported if the initial period is a stub period.  
  
**Rate interpolation for floating leg stub periods**
  Forward rates for floating leg stub periods with rate interpolation are calculated 
  according to ISDA specifications. Rate interpolation is not done once the index 
  fixings are known, i.e. the fixing date is in the past.
  
**Variable notional swaps and stub periods**
  For the combination of notional schedule and floating leg stub periods the 
  calculation of the last stub period accrual end and hence the period length 
  is incorrect.

**Effective/termination date**
  The effective/termination date must be the same on all legs.

**Unsupported FpML features**
  The following features provided by FpML are not supported:
  
  * An index rate spread schedule (i.e. a variable index spread) for floating swap legs
  * A rate schedule (i.e. a variable fixed rate) for fixed swap legs
  * relativeEffectiveDate/relativeTerminationDate
  * firstPeriodStartDate
  * effectiveDate adjustments
  * cap/floor/rateTreatment/discounting
  * negativeInterestRateTreatment (floor rate in model is not used)
  
FRA
___

**Payment date**
  The payment date must be the same as the start date.

**Payment business day convention**
  The payment business day convention provided in FpML is not used.

**Unsupported FpML features**
  The following features provided by FpML are not supported:
  
  * FRA trades entered with settlement in-arrears (and discounting method ``NONE``)
  * FRAs with an interpolated index
  * A fixing offset of calendar days or months/years

ZCIS
____

**Initial index level for inflation swaps**
  Setting an initial index level for zero coupon inflation swaps is not supported.

**Sensitivity-based input for inflation trades**
  It is not possible to enter zero coupon inflation swap trades as a sensitivity
  profile. However, the calculation of margin based on delta approximation for zero
  coupon inflation swap trades is supported.

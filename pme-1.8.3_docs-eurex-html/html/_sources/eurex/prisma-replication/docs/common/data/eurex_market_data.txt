Market Data
===========

Eurex Clearing members are provided with access to Transparency Enabler files to allow for replication of the margin
methodologies. An essential part of the OpenGamma implementation is the ability to load and interpret these files.

We distinguish between three categories of files: OTC, ETD and cross-margining. A category of files is only required
if the calculation involves it, either because there are OTC or ETD trades in the portfolio, or because
cross-margining is enabled.

OTC Requirements
----------------

The following Eurex files are required to calculate margin:

*	``202`` - Risk Factor Report
*	``210`` - Interest Rate Curves Report
*	``220`` - Liquidity Tables
*	``221`` - Initial Margin Configuration Set

The format and content of these files is described in *Eurex OTC Clear Risk Methodology Description*.

Index fixings and holiday calendars are also required but are not provided by Eurex. For more details, 
see :doc:`fixings` and :doc:`holidays`.
